      <description>Odoo: Access Technical Features In Odoo 9 you might miss the Technical Features checkbox in the Access Rights of your user. These settings are now visible if you activate the Developer Mode from the About menu.
I had to access this many times during development and found out, that I lose too much time accessing the menu and clicking on the button. I had to change this!
I created this small Bookmarklet, which toggles the developer mode by a single click&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Odoo: Dynamic image resizing</title>

      <description>Odoo: Scale images on the fly Odoo uses Python Imaging Library (PIL) to support image resizing on the fly. This functionality ships with the image.py module, which is located in openerp.tools.image.
Problem I implemented a custom model which defined a binary field called image:
class MyModel(models.Model): _name = &amp;#39;my.model&amp;#39; image = fields.Binary(&amp;#39;Image&amp;#39;, required=True) image_filename = fields.Char(&amp;#34;Image Filename&amp;#34;) I wanted to use this model within in a website view, but struggled with finding a suitable image source URL for the image field.</description>

      <title>Odoo: Remember the filename of binary files</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;odoo-remember-the-filename-of-binary-files&#34;&gt;Odoo: Remember the filename of binary files&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;problem&#34;&gt;Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to use a binary field to store image data to a custom model.
Therefore I used a field of the type &lt;code&gt;Binary&lt;/code&gt; in my model. Unfortunately only
the base64 encoded file was stored in the database but not the filename. This
resulted in an unknown binary file download with the name of the current model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
